        <p>Hello! My name is Susana Sun and I am a senior at Oakland Technical High School in the Computer Science Academy. I was born and raised in Oakland, California. I have a twin sister and 2 younger brothers. In my free time, I like to hang out with my family and friends, bake, code, swim, volunteer, and learn different foreign languages. I also love taking walks with my friends and going to different viewpoints around the Bay Area. Recently, I have been trying to learn more Mandarin, Korean, Spanish, and American Sign Language slowly over time. As of right now, I want to major in either computer science, data science, or business in college.</p>

 <h1 class= "subtitles">Purpose</h1>

    <div class="row border">
      <div class="col-12 border">
         <p> The purpose of my webpage is to raise awareness on mental health and how people can find help if they are facing any thoughts of suicide or need help with ways to stay relaxed. People can have a place to write down their thoughts or any emotions that they are feeling.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1 class= "subtitles">Audience</h1>
      <div class="col-12 border">
        <p>The audience can be adults, students, teenagers, or anyone who is struggling with mental health, or those who want to learn more about mental health issues/find ways to take care of themselves. </p>
     </div>

      <h1 class= "subtitles">Justification</h1>
      <div class="col-12 border">
        <ol>
            <li>Since the purpose is to raise awareness on mental health, I should include links to websites that people can view and gather more information to where they can get help. </li>
            <li>Since the topic can be very sensitive and personal, people should be able to write down their stories and thoughts in a safe place where they can reflect on their personal life.</li>
            <li>Since the audience is a diverse group of people, the webpage should be inclusive and include information that can help everyone.</li>
            <li>Since the product (a web page) can be overwhelming with a lot of information, images and videos should be implemented into the website as well as an interactive area for writing personal thoughts to make the web page more engaging.</li>
        </ol>
